# OpenTelemetry Tracing for Supply Chain Agent

This document describes the OpenTelemetry tracing implementation in the Supply Chain Optimizer Agent.

## Overview

The Supply Chain Agent now includes comprehensive OpenTelemetry tracing support that provides:

- **End-to-end visibility** into supply chain optimization requests
- **Performance insights** for market analysis calls
- **Debugging capabilities** for complex business logic flows
- **Compliance tracking** for financial and policy decisions
- **Integration monitoring** between different agent services

## Architecture

### Tracing Flow

```
Test Client â†’ Supply Chain Agent â†’ Market Analysis Agent
     â†“              â†“                    â†“
  Creates      Extracts context      Receives context
  trace       Creates spans         Creates child spans
  context     Propagates headers    Links to parent trace
```

### Span Structure

- **Root Span**: Test client request
- **Child Spans**: 
  - Supply chain optimization
  - Business policy validation
  - Market analysis call
  - Response processing

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or set these environment variables:

```bash
# Agent URLs
SUPPLY_CHAIN_AGENT_URL=http://localhost:9999/
MARKET_ANALYSIS_AGENT_URL=http://localhost:9998/

# OpenTelemetry Tracing Configuration
JAEGER_HOST=localhost
JAEGER_PORT=4317

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### Tracing Backends

#### Console Exporter (Default)
- Always enabled for development
- Outputs spans to console/logs
- Useful for debugging and development

#### Jaeger Exporter
- Set `JAEGER_HOST` to enable
- Default port: 4317
- Provides web UI for trace visualization

## Usage

### Starting the Agent with Tracing

```bash
# Start with console tracing only
python -m supply_chain_agent

# Start with Jaeger tracing
JAEGER_HOST=localhost python -m supply_chain_agent
```

### Testing Tracing

Run the test client to see tracing in action:

```bash
cd supply-chain-agent
python test_client.py
```

The test client will:
1. Generate unique trace contexts for each test
2. Display trace IDs and span IDs
3. Show how context propagates through the system

## Tracing Features

### Context Propagation

The agent automatically:
- Extracts trace context from incoming HTTP headers
- Creates child spans for business operations
- Propagates context to downstream services (market analysis agent)
- Links all spans in a single trace

### Business Logic Tracing

#### Policy Validation
- Spans for each policy check
- Attributes for validation results
- Events for warnings and violations

#### Supply Chain Analysis
- Spans for request analysis
- Attributes for optimization focus areas
- Events for recommendation generation

#### Market Analysis Integration
- Spans for client creation
- Spans for API calls
- Attributes for response processing

### Span Attributes

Key attributes are automatically added to spans:

```python
# Request attributes
"request.text": "optimize laptop supply chain"
"request.has_content": True

# Business logic attributes
"analysis.focus_area": "laptop_inventory"
"analysis.optimization_goal": "cost_optimization"

# Policy validation attributes
"validation.order_value": 75000
"validation.vendor": "Dell"
"validation.is_valid": True
```

### Span Events

Important business events are recorded:

```python
# Policy events
"policy_validation_started"
"policy_violation"
"policy_warning"

# Business logic events
"focus_area_determined"
"recommendations_generated"
"market_analysis_requested"
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Start the agent**:
   ```bash
   python -m supply_chain_agent
   ```

2. **Run test client**:
   ```bash
   python test_client.py
   ```

3. **Check console output** for span information

### Jaeger Testing

1. **Start Jaeger** (using Docker):
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name jaeger \
     -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
     -p 16686:16686 \
     -p 6831:6831 \
     jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
   ```

2. **Set environment**:
   ```bash
   export JAEGER_HOST=localhost
   export JAEGER_PORT=4317
   ```

3. **Start agent and run tests**

4. **View traces** at http://localhost:16686

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Tracing Not Working
- Check that OpenTelemetry dependencies are installed
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check console for initialization messages

#### Spans Not Appearing
- Ensure tracing is initialized before agent creation
- Check that spans are created within proper context
- Verify console exporter is enabled

#### Context Not Propagating
- Check HTTP headers are properly formatted
- Verify trace context extraction logic
- Ensure child spans are created with parent context

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Console Output

When console exporter is enabled, you'll see output like:

```
ðŸ”— Initializing OpenTelemetry tracing...
ðŸ”— Tracing configured with console exporter only
ðŸš€ Starting Supply Chain Agent on port 9999
```

## Performance Considerations

### Span Limits
- Attribute values are truncated to 100 characters
- Large objects are converted to strings
- Events include only essential information

### Sampling
- All spans are sampled by default
- Can be configured for production environments
- Consider sampling strategies for high-traffic scenarios

### Storage
- Console exporter: No persistent storage
- Jaeger exporter: Configurable retention policies
- Consider data volume for production deployments

## Production Deployment

### Recommended Configuration

```bash
# Production environment
ENVIRONMENT=production
JAEGER_HOST=jaeger.internal.company.com
JAEGER_PORT=4317
ENABLE_CONSOLE_EXPORTER=false

# Optional: Custom sampling
OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=parentbased_traceidratio
OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=0.1
```

### Monitoring

- Monitor Jaeger storage usage
- Set up alerts for trace failures
- Track span duration metrics
- Monitor context propagation success rates

## Integration with Other Services

### Market Analysis Agent
- Context automatically propagated via HTTP headers
- Child spans created for each API call
- Error handling with span status updates

### Future Integrations
- Database operations
- External API calls
- Message queue operations
- File system operations

## Contributing

### Adding New Spans

1. Import tracing utilities:
   ```python
   from .tracing_config import span, add_event, set_attribute
   ```

2. Create spans for operations:
   ```python
   with span("operation_name") as span_obj:
       # Your operation logic
       add_event("operation_started")
       set_attribute("operation.type", "example")
   ```

3. Add meaningful attributes and events

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive span names
- Include relevant business attributes
- Record important events
- Handle errors with proper span status
- Keep attribute values concise
